## 📊 Overview
This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of road accident data across the United Kingdom. My goal was to uncover patterns and insights that could inform public safety strategies, transportation planning, and policy decisions.

The dashboard visualises key metrics such as:
- Total accidents and casualty trends over time
- Casualty breakdown by severity (fatal, serious, slight)
- Vehicle types involved in accidents
- Weather and road surface conditions
- Road types and geographic distribution of incidents

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
All data preprocessing was performed directly within Tableau using:
- Custom calculated fields
- Data filtering and cleaning
- Aggregation and grouping
- Parameter controls for interactive filtering

This approach ensured a seamless integration between data transformation and visualization, allowing for real-time exploration and analysis.

## 📍 Key Features
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter data by accident severity to explore specific trends.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: A UK map displays accident locations using density-based markers.
- **Vehicle Type Breakdown**: Bar and pie charts show how different vehicle categories contribute to casualty numbers.
- **Environmental Conditions**: Weather and road surface data are visualized to assess external factors.
- **Road Type Analysis**: Highlights which road infrastructures are most associated with accidents.


## 📈 Insights
- The majority of casualties occurred in **fine weather** and on **dry roads**, suggesting that human factors may outweigh environmental ones.
- **Cars** account for the largest share of casualties, followed by **vans** and **motorcycles**.
- **Single carriageways** are the most common road type involved in accidents.
